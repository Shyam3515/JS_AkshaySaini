//undefined is the value allocated to 'a' before running the code.
//This is the value which JSE allocated to 'a' while creating the memory.
let a = 6;

// console.log(x) not defined is something which has not been allocated memory.

/**
1.Undefined is a Special Placeholder which is used to reserve memory for the variables in the memory creation phase. Even before a single line of code is executed JS engine assigns undefined to the variables.
2. undefined !== not defined, Not Defined means if we try to console or access any variable which is not declared in the code then we get Not Defined error.
3. JS- weakly typed language since it doesn't depend on data type declarations.
JS is a loosely typed language or weakly typed language means it does not attaches its variables to specific data types like in C++ and java.
