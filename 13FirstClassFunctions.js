/**
 * For Revision
Function statement / Function Declaration : the function is normally defined and can be used later on
Function expression : the function is first created and assigned to a variable so that it can be called by its variable name and unless it is defined, it cannot be executed otherwise it throws out "Uncaught TypeError"

Anonymous function : function where there is no need to define name for the function, it just can be assigned to variable
Named function : Normal function with its name assigned to a variable !!In this case you cannot call function by its name in outer scope!! (Scope Chain)

first class Functions / first class citizens : 
1) used as values
2) can be passed as argument
3) can be executed inside a closured function
4) can be taken as return

6.  What is First Class Function Or First class citizens?
A.   The Ability of using function as value,
*     Can be passed as an Argument,
*     Can be executed inside a closured function &
*     Can be taken as return form.
       For Ex - var b = function(param){
                             return function xyz(){
                                     console.log(" F C F ");
                             }
                     } 
                console.log(b());

7. Function are heart of JS. They are called first class citizens or first class functions because they have the ability to be stored in the variables, passed as parameters and arguments. They can also be returned in the function.

/**
 * 1.  What is Function Statement ?
A.  A normal function that we create using Naming convention. & By this we can do the Hoisting.
      For Ex  -  function xyz(){
                            console.log("Function Statement");
                       }

2.  What is Function Expression ?
A.  When we assign a function into a variable that is Function Expression & Variable is hoisted. It means it cannot execute as function until it is defined as function.
      For Ex - var a = function(){
                            console.log("Function Expression");
                    }
 */
var b = function () {
  console.log("first");
  return function xyz() {
    console.log(" F C F ");
  };
};
b()();

function retirement(retirementAge) {
  var a = " years left until retirement.";
  return function (yearOfBirth) {
    var age = 2016 - yearOfBirth;
    console.log(retirementAge - age + a);
  };
}
var retirementUS = retirement(66);
retirementUS(1990);
//we can call it in two ways
retirement(66)(1990);

// What Are First-Class Functions?
// In programming languages that support first-class functions, functions are treated as first-class citizens. This means functions in these languages:

// Can be assigned to variables: You can store a function in a variable.
// Can be passed as arguments: You can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
// Can be returned from other functions: You can return functions from other functions.
// Can be stored in data structures: You can store functions in arrays, objects, etc.
// Your Code and First-Class Functions
// In your code, the inner function returned by retirement is a first-class function because:

// Returned from Another Function: The retirement function returns another function (the inner function), demonstrating that functions can be returned from other functions.

function retirement(retirementAge) {
  var a = " years left until retirement.";
  return function (yearOfBirth) {
    var age = 2016 - yearOfBirth;
    console.log(retirementAge - age + a);
  };
}

// Assigned to a Variable: The returned function can be assigned to a variable, which is demonstrated by:
var retirementUS = retirement(66);
// Here, retirementUS is a variable that holds the inner function.
// Called Later: The retirementUS function can be called later with a yearOfBirth, which shows that functions can be invoked at different times and places.

retirementUS(1990); // Output: "26 years left until retirement."
// Passed as an Argument: Although not shown in this snippet, you could pass the returned function to another function if needed.

// Conclusion
// Yes, the inner function in your code is a first-class function. It can be treated as a valueâ€”assigned to variables, passed around as an argument, returned from other functions, and stored in data structures. This flexibility is a hallmark of first-class functions in JavaScript.
